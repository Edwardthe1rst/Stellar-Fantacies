# Ability Scores
Ability Scores represent what your character is naturally good or bad at and determine your bonuses, which are the numbers you will add to almost every roll in the game.
## Dark Side
Every Force-Sensitive creature (this includes most player characters) has a Dark Side score, which represents how much they are fed by strong emotion, such as passion, hate, or extreme loss. The more you indulge in strong emotion and therefore the Dark Side of the Force, the stronger their emotions become, and so too does their power in the Dark Side of the Force.
### Dark Side Checks
Dark side checks are very rare. Instead, the Dark Side bonus is added on top of other bonuses when other checks are made.
### Adding Dark Side to Other Checks
Any time you make a check in order to achieve an action driven by strong emotion, your dark side bonus can be used.
### Checks Using Tools, Weapons, or Equipment
If a check using some sort of implement, they cannot add their Dark Side bonus to it unless the implement is a force object (see the Force Acolyte heroic class).
### Dark & Light Side Characters
Your Dark side score and Wisdom score are compared to determine if you are a Light Side or Dark Side character.
If your Dark side score is less than your Wisdom score, you are a Light Side character and lose access to Dark Side only abilities.
If your Dark side score is greater than your Wisdom score, you are a Dark Side character and lose access to Light Side only abilities.
If your Dark side score is double your Wisdom score or greater, you are a Dark Consumed character.
If your Dark side and Wisdom scores are equal, you are a grey character and have access to both Dark Side and Light Side only abilities.
### Dark Urges
The Dark Side of the Force amplifies emotions. Due to this, when a Dark side character encounters a situation when they feel intense emotions, they feel them more deeply.
When a Dark side character feels intense emotions or faces something that should trigger intense emotions (ST discretion), they must make a Willpower Defense roll with a DC equal to their Dark side Score.
If they fail, an emotion of the ST's choice (though the ST can ask the player for suggestions) is stirred in the character and they continue to be nigh overwhelmed by the emotion for the rest of the encounter. This intense emotion should be the dominate motivation for the character in this scene.
Whilst affected by a Dark Urge and an opportunity comes to indulge that urge, the ST can have the character roll a Willpower Defense roll. If they fail, the character acts on that indulgence.
### Dark Consumed Character
If you fail the Willpower Defense roll and your Dark side score is double your Wisdom score or greater, rather than being on the brink of being overwhelmed by emotion, the character is completely consumed by emotion. When an opportunity comes to indulge the urge, the ST can have the character do the action, with no chance to resist.
### Ending a Dark Urge
With two standard actions, the character can attempt to calm themselves down and make a Wisdom (Use the Force) check with a DC equal to their Darkside Score.
If the check is a success, they manage to focus on something else to calm themselves, thus bringing their emotions back under control.
If they fail, they are still under the effect, and any future attempts to break the urge in the same encounter are made at -5. They are only reminded of the reason for their emotion, and it intensifies.
## Ability Scores
The following ability scores affect Willpower:
| Ability  | Effect  |
| -- | -- |
| Dexterity| (See PHB Chapter 2) |
| Charisma | (See PHB Chapter 2) |
| Constitution | (See PHB Chapter 2) |
| Intelligence | (See PHB Chapter 2) |
| Strength | (See PHB Chapter 2) |
### Willpower Score
Willpower measures the soundness of mind and strength of will. It determines your character's drive to push through trouble and their ability to control their own impulses.
### Moral Debuffs (Optional)
When something demoralizing happens, you may receive a moral debuff to your Willpower score. The amount and duration are determined by the DM.
### Sanity Score (Optional)
When working with the Horror optional rule, Willpower takes on the role of sanity as well. When you gain a madness, you also take permanent 1d4 Willpower damage. This damage can only be healed by a Greater Restoration or similar spell.
## Willpower Checks/Saves
### Key Uses
Resisting mind-altering effects (this can override what ability is used for certain spell saving throws and the like.)
Death saving throws (If this is used, the death save DC is raised to 13)
- Sanity Check
- Deciphering a piece of text written in a language so alien that it threatens to break the reader's mind
- Overcoming a lingering effect of madness
## Wisdom
(See PHB Chapter 2)
## Determining Ability Scores
### Ability Array
 Variant Player
An ability array is a group of numbers that you can use to determine your core abilities. It's the simplest method for calculating your stats.
### Ability Arrays
| Level| Array Values  |
| -- | - |
| Low  | 8, 10, 10, 10, 12, 14, 15 |
| Standard | 8, 10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 |
| High | 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 |
| Epic | 8, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 16 |
### Point Buy
#### Point Buy System
All ability scores start at 8. The points given can be spread out among all abilities.
For ability scores of 14 or lower, you buy additional points on a 1-for-1 basis. For ability scores higher than 14, it costs a little more (see the table below). This method allows for maximum customization, but you should expect each PC to have at least one really good score.
#### Point Buy Costs
See the [Point Buy Costs](#Point-Buy-Costs) table
**Species-Based Maximum Scores**
Your maximum ability score is determined by your species' Ability Score Increase. To determine your max score for that ability, add 20 to your species's Ability Score Increase.
### Species-Based Max Scores Table
Add your species's Ability Score Increase to 20 to find the max score for each ability.
**Lona the Forest Gnome**
Is trying to figure out her max scores. Since she gains +2 intelligence from being a gnome, she has a max intelligence of 22. 
Since she gains +1 Dex from being a forest gnome, she has a max Dex of 21.
The rest of her stats have a max of 20, since she has no pluses in those abilities due to species.
#### Point Buy System
| Play Style | Point Pool |
| - | - |
| Low| 28 |
| Standard   | 31 |
| High   | 34 |
| Epic   | 39 |
#### Point Buy Costs
| Score | Cost |
| -- | - |
| 6 | 0|
| 8 | 1|
| 9 | 2|
| 10| 3|
| 11| 4|
| 12| 5|
| 13| 6|

## Bith
- **Reference Book**: Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue
### Description
The Bith have been part of The Galactic Republic for thousands of years. Intellectually advanced humanoids, Bith have over-sized brains evolved to handle abstract skills such as language, mathematics, music, and scientific analysis. This fundamental shift to the intellect has caused brain functions related to instinct and biological drives to diminish. Their greater brainpower also means that Bith need to spend only four hours in a meditative trance to regain the energy that most Species require eight hours to recover.
As a culture, Bith find the concept of warfare abhorrent, and most are pacifists. During the time of the Republic, the Bith are one of the loudest proponents for finding diplomatic solutions and for banning weapons and the industries of war. This pacifistic streak has roots in the Bith's past, when competition between two major corporations got out of hand, resulting in the release of a biological weapon that turned the surface of Clak'dor VII into an ecological wasteland. The survivors consequently sealed their cities in immense domes, while many ambitious Bith left their homeworld to travel the galaxy. During the time of the Clone Wars, the Bith hole up in their domed cities, remaining neutral and trying to ride out the worst of the fighting. Their wholesale return to galactic society does not occur until well into the time of The New Republic.
Bith are highly sought after in a wide variety of fields, including:
- Engineering

Few patterns or trends escape the notice of a Cerean.

## Clawdite
**Reference: Book - Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy**
### Description
A specially bred offshoot of Zolanders, Clawdites were genetically engineered to withstand the unsafe levels of radiation generated by an unstable sun. However, Clawdites developed an unexpected mutation - the ability to shapechange. The Zolanders deemed the Clawdites a dire threat - a devious subspecies filled with wickedness. Therefore, to guard against Clawdite treachery, the Zolanders sequestered them in wretched ghettos, where they live as second-class citizens under the watchful eyes of their captors.
The Clawdites chafe under the tyrannical yoke placed upon them, and those who can, flee, but more languish on their homeworld, struggling to find some way to be free. Count Dooku and the Separatist Movement offered the Clawdites the freedom they craved from the Zolanders, so many enlisted to support Count Dooku's war effort in exchange for his promise. The aid was short-lived, for the Separatist Movement unraveled with Count Dooku's death.
Only after the fall of the Empire did the Clawdites finally rise up against the Zolanders, fighting a brutal civil war that consumed the world in violence. The Clawdites eventually gained control of the planet, and in victory, they asserted themselves as the dominant species. Free, the Clawdites courted the New Republic, and threw their support behind Alliance Intelligence organizations, using their unique talents to infiltrate the Yuuzhan Vong, and sabotage equipment, gather intelligence, and assassinate critical targets.
The Clawdites took on this dangerous work because they are driven to support the cause of liberty, and for them, the end always justifies the means.
### Personality
Clawdites are staunchly committed to freedom and detest opposition in all its forms. Independent spirits, they go their own way, following their hearts rather than abide by a set of rules imposed on them. Above all, Clawdites hate bigotry and prejudice, and do not tolerate bullies. The more violent Clawdites are sure to make examples of those they encounter.

## Codru-Ji
**Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide**

### Description
The Codru-Ji have long been isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Highly xenophobic, they are reluctant to grant members of other Species access to their society. Though they do not fear other cultures, they are concerned that outsiders will somehow "rub off" on them and corrupt their own traditions and values.
Certain aspects of Codru-Ji culture are barbaric by galactic standards. Ritual kidnapping, especially the children of political rivals, is common. Though victims are generally returned unharmed, the experience can be frightening and off-putting to non-Codru-Ji. Visitors to Munto Codru are warned that they should never travel alone, lest they fall victim to abduction. Offworlders abducted by Codru-Ji in this manner are often forced to pay a ransom, either in the form of valuables or political favors.
Codru-Ji are skilled in many crafts, and are widely versatile; however, their limited room for shoulder muscles make their arms physically week.
### Personality
As a Species, the Codru-Ji are uncomfortable around outsiders and have trouble integrating into the galactic community. They are suspicious of others, looking for hidden motives in even the most mundane circumstances. Family ties are crucial to Codru-Ji, and they will do anything to protect their loved ones and family members, especially their children. A Codru-Ji who forms friendships with members of other Species comes to regard them as family, and can be just as protective of them as any other family member.
### Physical Description
All Codru-Ji have four arms, two legs, elongated faces, and pointed ears. Codru-Ji hair and eye colors tend toward dark, earthy browns. Codru-Ji juveniles, or Wyrwulves, resemble six-legged canines and are often mistaken for pets by offworlders who don't know any better.

## Devaronian
**Reference: Star Wars Saga Edition Web**
### Description
Being one of the first species in the galaxy to achieve interstellar travel, Devaronians are one of the few peoples as recognizable as near-humans. Despite their ubiquity, a simple fact about Devaronians is often confused. Unlike many other species, Devaronians are trioecious. Though many confuse the hermaphrodites for the females, Devaronians have three sexes that to those who do not know better, could be mistaken for three separate species.
The heart of the confusion between the hermaphrodites and females is the strong instinctual drives that have informed the sexes' roles in society. Male Devaronians are the most well-known. Their recognizability comes not only from their red skin and horned heads but also from their natural drive that injects them into the galaxy. When a male Devaronian reaches middle age, instinct kicks in as they develop an insatiable wanderlust. The furred female Devaronians, on the other hand, develop no such drive; instead, they have a milder instinct to stay put.
Due to this, Devaronian society evolved to have set roles: female Devaronians run the governments, industry, and infrastructure of Devaron and their planets, while the males act as scouts, ship captains, adventurers, diplomats, and other roles that galivant around. The visually near-human hermaphrodites play any role, though they too are driven by instinct. Whether they have the instinct to travel or stay put depends on what other Devaronians they are around. If a hermaphrodite is in a safe enough environment to support breeding while around a large number of Devaronians with an imbalance between male and female in the group, their instinct will shift to correct the imbalance to better preserve the population.
No matter which instinct they are feeling, even if they are feeling either, hermaphrodites pose the organs to mate with either of the other sexes. Many space-faring hermaphrodites medicate to either neutralize both or induce the desired instinct as space travel often confuses this biology, which mistakes the lack of other Devaronians nearby to be a sign of near extinction and so switches each time they encounter another Devaronian.
### Personality
Male Devaronians are bold, daring, bull-headed, rash, terse, unscrupulous, and stingy with their credits. They love being the masters of their own destinies.
Female Devaronians are generally bright, wise, scrupulous, and sharp-tongued.
The personality of hermaphrodites ranges anywhere between the two extremes.
### Physical Description
Male Devaronians are hairless with red-tinted skin, sharp incisors, and a pair of large horns growing from their foreheads. Their appearance is not unlike the devils of a thousand myths.
Female Devaronians are covered in thick fur that ranges in color from brown to white. Females are hornless and have prominent canine teeth.
Hermaphroditic Devaronians share the red skin with the males and the fur with the females, though only on their scalp and shoulders.
### Average Height/Weight
A typical Devaronian stands at 1.7 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms.
### Age Groups

- **Child**: 1-12 years
- **Young**: 13-17 years

### Automatic Languages
All Devaronians can speak, read, and write both Basic and Devaronese.
### Example Names
Dmaynel Kiph, Elassar Targon, Jubal, Kapp Dendo, Tyrn Jiton, Lak Jit, Oxbel, Saricia, Sires Vant, Trynic, Ulicx Vinaq, Vilmarh Grahrk.
### Adventurers
Male Devaronian heroes tend to be Scoundrels or Scouts. Invariably, they are found in occupations that allow them freedom to travel whenever and wherever they wish. Due to the oppressive nature of the Empire, many Devaronian males joined the Rebellion - not because of politics, but because they were annoyed that their freedom to travel was being curtailed.
Noteworthy female Devaronians on their homeworld tend to be Nobles and Scouts. However, any female Devaronian hero found elsewhere is already an exceptional individual who has decided to challenge the traditions of her culture. Such Devaronians may be of any class or role.
## Duros

Tall, hairless humanoids from the Duro System, Duros were one of the first species to become a major influence in the Galactic Republic, and many respected scholars credited the Duros with creating the first hyperdrive. The Duros have a natural affinity for space travel, possessing an innate grasp of the mathematical underpinnings of astrogational computations. Many tales are swapped in cantinas about Duros astrogators calculating the coordinates for supposedly impossible jumps in their heads. Although not as numerous as Humans, the Duros are almost as omnipresent; all but the smallest settlements in known space feature Duros populations.

## Falleen

**Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy**

### Description
Of all the species to populate the galaxy, none are better known for their intoxicating appearance than the Falleen. An exotic reptilian people, they are favored for their chiseled physiques and entrancing features. These qualities alone would solidify their place among the more handsome species, but their pheromones make them irresistible to other species.
Their gifts and allure enable the Falleen to move through other cultures with ease, but despite their advantages, Falleen prefer to remain mysterious, withdrawing to their own world in their own system. They do not lack the technology or wherewithal to venture out into the stars, but their cultural predilections make such ventures undesirable. The Falleen regard themselves and their civilization to be among the greatest in the galaxy, and looking beyond their world, they find only chaos and strife – the products of crudity and backward beings.
Associations with other species, therefore, are risky to the Falleen, and are approached with caution.
### Culture
Falleen culture reinforces the sense of superiority that pervades this species. Their rigid caste society confines them to societal roles, and provides stability and a sense of purpose. Other systems are far looser, with little to no regard for quality of birth or station. Rather than contaminate themselves and endanger their social system, the Falleen are content to remain apart from the rest of the galaxy.
### Personality
Falleen are notoriously sparse with words, reticent to the point of being withdrawn. Falleen believe emotional displays are unsophisticated. Therefore, they work to control their moods and expressions, deeply burying the wellspring of feelings that boil within.
### Physical Description
The Falleen are a reptilian species that have a similar shape and size to humans. Delicate blue-green scales, supple and flexible, cover their bodies, growing thicker and harder where they cover their spines. Falleen can and do grow hair, and for many, their hair is a point of pride. They wear their black tresses long, pulled up into topknots, or back in elaborate braids. Some adorn their luxuriant hair with combs, beads, and ornate nets made of priceless wire and gemstones.
### Height/Weight
A typical Falleen male stands at 1.6 meters tall and weighs 55 kilograms.
A typical Falleen female stands at 1.4 meters tall and weighs 45 kilograms.
### Age Groups

- **Child**: 1-18 years
- **Young Adult**: 19-36 years
- **Adult**: 37-72 years
- **Middle Age**: 73-139 years
- **Old**: 140-249 years
- **Venerable**: 250+ years
### Homeworld

### Example Names
Savan, 
Xad, 
Xist, 
Xizor, 
Xora, 
Zule, 
Zurros, 
### Adventurers
Falleen adventurers are privileged youth, the scions of the wealthy and powerful. It is customary on Falleen for Young adults to embark on pilgrimages into the galaxy to explore and learn about other cultures. During this time, the Falleen pilgrims are expected to engage with other cultures, finding their failures and successes. When the Falleen comes of age and claims their place at the head of their people, they can use their experiences to better rule their subjects.
### Falleen Species Traits
- **Ability Score Adjustment**: All Falleen receive a +2 bonus to their Charisma, but suffer a -2 penalty to their Wisdom.
- **Medium Size**: As Medium creatures, Falleen have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed**: Falleen have a base speed of 6 spaces.
- **Hold Breath**: Falleen are at home in air or water. A Falleen can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 25 times their Constitution score before they need to start making Endurance checks.
- **Pheromones**: As a Standard Action, a Falleen can make a special attack against any adjacent creature. The attack bonus is equal to the Falleen's Character Level plus their Charisma bonus. If the attack equals or exceeds the target's Fortitude Defense, that target moves 1 step along the Attitude Track towards helpful. This effect reverts after the target spends 1 minute away from the Falleen or other Falleen coordinating their pheromones with the first.
If the attack fails to beat the target's Fortitude Defense, the target is immune to the Falleen's Pheromones for 24 hours. Pheromones function as an Inhaled Poison. Any creature holding its breath is unaffected (see Endurance for more details). A creature can be affected by Falleen Pheromones only once per round. Multiple exposures to Pheromones from different Falleen in the same round produce no additional effects.
- **Pheromone Acclimation**: Falleen gain a +5 Species bonus to their Fortitude Defense against the Pheromones of other Falleen.
### Automatic Languages
 All Falleen can speak, read, and write both Basic and Falleen.
## Gungan
### Description
The Gungans are omnivorous humanoids native to the swamps of Naboo. Technologically advanced, they rely mostly on biotech, growing instead of building their homes and production facilities.

## Hutts
### Description
Hutts are long-lived gastropods who occupy a region known as Hutt Space. They are powerful, ruthless beings who continually seek to expand the boundaries of their dominion and the holdings of their individual clans, or Kajidics. Their appetite for power is as insatiable as their appetite for food.
Hutts are often found at the center of business and criminal enterprises. Legality (or lack thereof) does not affect whether a Hutt will pursue a venture. All that matters is how much of a benefit and a profit one can get from it.
Like worms, Hutts are hermaphroditic, with both male and female reproductive organs. Hutts bear their Young one at a time and nourish them for a time in a brood pouch. Their large lungs enable them to stay underwater for hours at a time. Xenobiologists often classify Hutts as gastropods because of their slug-like appearance and movements.
A council of elders oversees Hutt Space. Comprised of Hutts representing the oldest and most influential clans, The Hutt Kajidics decide the fate of everyone who lives in Hutt Space, and all Hutts are answerable to them.
### Personality
Most Hutts are vicious megalomaniacs who consider their kind to be beyond mortality as perceived by lesser beings. They have a talent for manipulating other beings and enjoy accumulating and exerting power over others. A Hutt's strongest loyalty is always to their Kajidic, without which a Hutt is nothing but a lowly commoner.
### Physical Description
A Hutt is an immense, slug-like creature with a thick body, muscular tail, and small arms protruding from its upper body. A Hutt's bulbous head features cat-like eyes, wide nostrils, and a broad lipless mouth. An adult Hutt averages 4 meters long and weighs 1,500 kilograms.
### Age Groups

- **Child**: 1-70 years
- **Young**: 71-90 years
- **Adult**: 91-650 years
- **Middle Age**: 651-844 years
- **Old**: 845-925 years
- **Venerable**: 926+ years
### Homeworld
Hutts evolved on the temperate forest world of Varl. When a natural calamity left Varl a blasted wasteland, the Hutts fled and adopted a new homeworld: Nal Hutta, in the Y'Toub System on the border of the Mid and Outer Rim.
### Languages
Hutts speak, read, and write both Basic and Huttese. However, they consider their own language superior to Basic and usually demand that lesser beings address them in their native tongue.
### Example Names
Borga, 
Churabba, 
Dalla, 
Durga, 
Gardulla, 
Grelb, 
Grondo, 
Issulla, 
Jabba, 
Krova, 
Mardoc, 
Mika, 
Nullada, 
Popara, 
Shala, 
Yarella, 
Zonnos, 
Zordo
### Adventurers
Very few Hutts manifest any desire to explore space or place themselves in harm's way. They prefer to travel the stars on space yachts or command their mini-empires from heavily fortified estates. Hutt Nobles are common, while exiled or disgraced Hutts sometimes become Scoundrels. At least one Hutt of repute has trained as a Jedi, although Hutt Force-users are exceedingly rare.

## Jawa
Reference: Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy
### Description
Jawas are short humanoids native to Tatooine. The Jawas have a poor reputation and are regarded as thieves at best, vermin at worst. Their off-putting nature is made worse by the sour smell that clings to them and their inexplicable and nonsensical language. Jawas survive by scavenging lost technology in the desert wastes. "Lost" for Jawas is ambiguous; they are likely to snatch up anything that's not bolted down. Moisture farmers and others who live far from Spaceports regularly find that their belongings have vanished in the night with only tell-tale Jawa tracks leading off into the wasteland.
Jawas are intelligent and have a complex society. Gathering in extended tribes, Jawa life revolves around trade - not for wealth, but for survival. Jawas look for guidance from their shamans, usually a female Jawa with the ability to portent the future and cast vicious hexes. Once a year, the Jawa tribes gather in the Dune Sea to exchange sons and daughters, to swap stories and news, and to mingle among their own kind.
A fleeing Jawa seeks out its allies and comes back in numbers to deal with threats.
Even then, Jawas rarely confront their enemies directly, preferring to sabotage or steal vital equipment and let the desert do the nasty work for them.
A Jawa can become fierce- even vicious- when cornered or when a shaman is threatened.
### Personality
Jawas are peaceful, preferring flight to confrontations. They are, however, extremely cunning and capable of great treachery if given cause.
### Physical Description
Jawas wear brown hooded cloaks to protect themselves from the oppressive heat of the twin suns of Tatooine. They dip their clothing in a rancid soup to better seal in their moisture. This gives them their infamously unpleasant odor. Jawas have sensitive, glowing orange eyes and are easily blinded by bright light.
Beneath their coverings, Jawas are slight rodent creatures with tiny hands and feet.
### Average Height/Weight
A typical Jawa male stands at 1.0 meter tall and weighs 25 kilograms, while a typical Jawa female stands at 1.0 meter tall and weighs 20 kilograms.
### Age Groups
- **Child**: 1-9 years
- **Young**: 10-14 years
- **Adult**: 15-39 years
- **Middle Age**: 40-59 years
- **Old**: 60-79 years
- **Venerable**: 80+ Years
### Homeworld
Jawas are found almost exclusively on the desert world of Tatooine, in The Outer Rim.
### Languages
The Jawa tongue is a complex language that involves as much gesture and smells as it does sounds. Lacking the organs to form words in Basic, and confronted with the fact that other Species cannot speak Jawa, they developed a shorthand speech called the Jawa Trade Language.
### Example Names
Akkit, Het, Oklect, Klepti, Tikkit, Tteel
### Adventurers
Family is the heart of Jawa society and as such, they are loath to leave their extended tribal groups. A lone Jawa likely has been driven out of their tribe, or they might be a lone survivor of an attack by Tusken Raiders or other desert denizens.
### Jawa Species Traits
- **Ability Score Adjustment**: All Jawas receive a +2 bonus to their Dexterity, but suffer a -2 penalty to their Strength.
- **Small Size**: As Small creatures, Jawas gain a +1 size bonus to their Reflex Defense and a +5 size bonus to their initiative.
- **Stealth**: Jawas have proficiency in Stealth checks.
However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed**: Jawas have a base speed of 4 spaces.
- **Darkvision**: Jawas ignore Obscurement (including Total Obscurement) from darkness. However, they cannot perceive colors in total darkness.
- **Desert Dweller**: When making Survival checks to resist the effects of Extreme Heat, Jawas can reroll the check, keeping the better of the two results.
- **Scavenger**: Whenever a Jawa armed with an Ion weapon successfully damages a Droid or Vehicle, the Jawa adds half their Character Level in Ion damage.
- **Tinkerer**: A Jawa can choose to reroll any Mechanics check, but must keep the second result, even if it is worse. In addition, Mechanics is always a Class Skill for Jawas.
### Automatic Languages
 All Jawas can speak, read, and write both Jawaese and the Jawa Trade Language.
## Kaleesh

**Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide**

### Description
The Kaleesh are a nomadic Species with a tribal culture. They are spiritual beings who worship their ancestors as deities, and they consider their ancestral burial grounds to be sacred lands. The Kaleesh believe that anyone who dies in honorable service to their people becomes a god upon death.
The Kaleesh come to a momentary prominence in the galaxy when they fight off an invasion by an alien Species known as the Huk. Having already subjugated and exploited the natural resources of several worlds, the Huk capture millions of Kaleesh and sell them into slavery. However, the Huk invasion of Kalee is short-lived. Under the leadership of a hero who eventually comes to be known as Grievous, the Kaleesh repel the Huk. They doggedly pursue their enemies into space, and the Huk are completely overcome by the Kaleesh. The hunters become the hunted. The Huk request assistance from the Republic, and through a number of underhanded dealings, they receive it. As a result, the Republic subjects the Kaleesh to serve economic sanctions, and the Kaleesh are marginalized by galactic society.
### Personality
Kaleesh are a warlike Species, but they reserve their ire for those who provoke them. They are protective of their territory—especially their ancient burial grounds. Kaleesh hold their families and tribes in high esteem, and do anything to protect them. These sentiments sometimes extend to non-Kaleesh who prove themselves to be trustworthy companions, but such a distinction is rare. Honor and sacrifice at the expense of oneself are highly valued qualities in their society.
### Physical Description
The Kaleesh are tall, reptilian humanoids. Their scaly skin varies from deep red to dull yellow. Their black hair is worn in long braids, or tied up in a queue or topknot. The long faces of the Kaleesh are framed on either side by two sharp tusks that extend outward from their jawbones, and their nostrils are two long slits that stretch toward their yellow eyes. However, few non-Kaleesh have seen the faces of these enigmatic aliens, for they wear masks made from the skulls of some of Kalee's most vicious predators. The Kaleesh are also distinguished by their hands, which each feature four long fingers, two of which are fully opposable.
### Average Height/Weight

A typical Kaleesh male stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs 80 kilograms.
A typical Kaleesh female stands at 1.6 meters tall and weighs 75 kilograms.
### Age Groups
- **Child**: 1-9 years

 The craggy world of Kalee, located in Wild Space.
### Example Names
Qymaen jai Sheelal, Ronderu lij Kummar, Bentilais san Sk'ar
### Adventurers and Species Traits
The Kaleesh excel in the roles of Scout and Soldier. Given their inherent sense of honor and dignity, they also make excellent Nobles, but rarely take on the role of a Scoundrel.

- Persistent: A Kaleesh can reroll any Endurance check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Penalties**: Kaleesh suffer a -2 penalty to both their Dexterity and Intelligence scores.
# Kaminoan

**Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide**

The watery planet of Kamino is home to a species of cloners known as Kaminoans.
### Description
These tall aliens are the result of generations of selective breeding and genetic modification that began when their world suffered a drastic change in climate. These restrictive breeding programs have made Kaminoans an extremely adaptable species.
Apart from gender, Kaminoans have little variation, and to the untrained eye they all look the same. Subtle variations have been introduced into their genetic codes, however, allowing for diversity within a strict set of parameters.
### Economy
The economy of Kamino is based on cloning for profit, but not every Kaminoan is a cloner by trade. The majority of Kaminoans support their communities with various skills and specialized abilities. They strive to perform their work flawlessly and seek perfection.
### Personality
Kaminoans see themselves as superior to other forms of life. They harbor a private intolerance for imperfection, but they are, nonetheless, polite to outsiders. To a Kaminoan, any Species that seeks self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior and deserve their inevitable decline. This attitude is reflected in their cloning processes, where entire crops of clones might be eliminated due to a single, subtle flaw.
Because Kaminoans are moderately xenophobic and rarely venture away from their homeworld, they are a rare sight in other parts of the galaxy.
### Physical Description
Kaminoans are tall and gaunt, with pale skin, three-fingered hands, and long necks. Their faces are small and dominated by a pair of large, black eyes. Every male Kaminoan has a finlike crest on the top of his head, but female Kaminoans have no such feature.
### Average Height/Weight
A typical Kaminoan male stands at 2.7 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms, while a typical Kaminoan female stands at 2.1 meters tall and weighs 65 kilograms.

The ocean world of Kamino, located in The Outer Rim.
### Languages
Kaminoans learn their own language of Kaminoan, and most learn Basic in their adulthood.
### Example Names
Ava Lim, Lama Su, Maru Lan, Tau Shei, Taga Sai, Seva Ke, Taun We
### Adventurers
Because they are genetically designed, Kaminoans are bred to fulfill a specific role or niche. They make excellent Nobles, Scouts, and Soldiers. Scoundrels, though rare, are not unheard of.

### Kaminoan Species Traits

### Automatic Languages

The Kel Dor evolved on Dorin, a world with an atmosphere consisting mostly of helium and a unique gas that is toxic to most nonnative life. To survive on other planets, Kel Dors must wear breath masks and goggles.
### Atmospheric Dependence
On other planets, Kel Dors dwellings provide their native atmosphere (stored in large tanks). When outside, they must wear protective gear:
Breath masks: amplify the wearer's speech and filter air for safe breathing.
Goggles: prevent eye damage from non-native atmospheric gases.
Vocal amplification: vocoders built into breath masks allow Kel Dors to communicate effectively.

They become Blind in bright light conditions.

Kel Dor characters begin play with these items at no cost. An Antiox Breath Mask is poisonous to other species.
### Automatic Languages

## Nautolans

**Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide**

### Description
Nautolans are one of the sentient species native to the planet Glee Anselm. Their language, Nautila, evolved underwater and is heavily tied to pheromones. Out of water, Nautila loses much of its meaning. As a result, Nautolans learn another language, typically either Basic or Anselmian, the language of the Anselmi people, who are native to Glee Anselm's land masses.
Even though they are aquatic, Nautolans have little difficulty living in climates that would be uncomfortable for other amphibians. They are a hardy species, due in part to the extra cartilage that supports their skeletal structures. Given their aquatic origins, they are excellent swimmers.
### Personality
Nautolans are loyal and steadfast companions. They wear their moods on their proverbial sleeves, expressing both joy and despair with equal zeal. Though polite and civilized under most circumstances, Nautolans tend to reflect the moods of others around them. The tendrils on their heads sense the pheromones released by others. This can inadvertently affect a Nautolan's disposition - for better or for worse. Despite their peaceful nature, Nautolans are not above defending themselves.
### Physical Description
Nautolans have thick green skin that is covered in dark, mottled spots. Their large, black eyes allow them to see well in dim light. Each Nautolan's head is crowned by long, tentacle-like tendrils, which the Nautolan decorates with leather bands, metal rings, or beaded ties.

Ploss Niklos, 
Renko Losa,

Offworld, Quarren generally stay clear of galactic politics. Instead, they often become involved with shadowy occupations such as pirates, smugglers, and spy networks. Many Quarren blame both the Empire and the Rebels (even more than the Mon Calamari) for their homeworld's devastation during the Galactic Civil War.

## Rodian
### Description
The Rodians hail from the Tyrius System of The Mid Rim, their homeworld being humid and choked with heavy rain forests teeming with dangerous life forms. In this hostile environment, the Rodians evolved into brutal hunters and killers to survive.
As a result, Rodian culture centers around the concept of "The Hunt." Their art glorifies violence and the art of stalking prey. The more intelligent and dangerous a hunter's prey, the more honorable the hunt. Rodians have numerous annual festivals that exist solely to honor such activities.
Since joining the rest of the galaxy's spacefaring species, the Rodians have come to view bounty hunting as the most honorable profession in existence, and many have found great success in this field.

## DROIDs
**v1.1**

If you want to play a droid as a hero, you can either play an existing droid from this section or create your own unique droid hero.
Droid heroes are assumed either to be "self-owned" or to be owned by another player character (with the approval of both the Gamemaster and the player in question).
Even if owned by another member of the party, the Gamemaster should ensure that the owner does not abuse their authority by giving unreasonable or unwanted orders to the other player's droid character.
### Droid Player Character Guidelines
A Droid player character should be treated the same as any other player character, and in most cases, it is best to give suggestions or advice instead of actual orders. (In fact, most Droid heroes have a Heuristic Processor so that they can creatively interpret orders and thus justify acting as they wish.)
### Standard Models
- **Movement Speed**: 6 spaces.
- **Droid Size**
You can choose to play a Large, Medium, Small, or Tiny droid. Droids of other sizes exist but are controlled by the GM.
A Droid's size determines its Ability modifiers, its size bonus to Reflex Defense, its size bonus on Stealth checks, adjustments to Damage Threshold, its Carrying Capacity, and its Cost Factor as shown in the table below.
### Droid Size Table
| **Size** | **Ability Score Adjustment** | **Special Size Modifiers**   | **Cost Factor** |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Large| +2 Strength, -2 Dexterity | -1 Reflex Defense, -5 Stealth, +2 Damage Reduction, +5 Damage Threshold, Twice the carrying capacity | 2x |
| Medium | No special modifiers due to size | None | 1x |
| Small | +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength | +1 Reflex Defense, +5 Stealth, -2 Damage Threshold, 3/4 the carrying capacity | 2x |
| Tiny | +4 Dexterity, -4 Strength| +2 Reflex Defense, +10 Stealth, -5 Damage Threshold, 1/2 the carrying capacity  | 5x |
### Droid Traits
- **Automatic Languages**: All droids can speak, read, and process Binary as well as understand one language chosen by the designer (usually Basic).
### Droid Traits
- **Automatic Languages**: All droids can speak, read, and process Binary as well as understand one language chosen by the designer (usually Basic).

- **Behavioral Inhibitors**: Droids (except 4th-Degree droids) cannot intentionally harm a sentient living being or knowingly allow a sentient living being to be harmed. Furthermore, all droids must follow orders given to them by their rightful owners as long as those orders don't require the droid to harm a sentient living being.
- **Droids with Heuristic Processors**: can sometimes violate these restrictions by creatively interpreting their behavioral inhibitors.
- **Ion Damage Vulnerability**: As electronic constructs, droids are vulnerable to damage from Ion Weapons. Generally, Ion Damage has the same effects on droids that Stun Damage has on living beings.
- **Maintenance**:Droids do not sleep, eat, or breathe. However, they do need to enter shutdown mode and fix all issues before being used again.

- **Recharge**:A Droid must recharge for 1 hour after 100 hours of operation. If a Droid fails to do so, it must make an Endurance check each hour (DC 10, +1 per additional hour after the first) or gain a -1 to all checks and rolls. Once this penalty reaches -6 they shut down.

- **Persistent Condition**: This condition can only be removed by the Droid recharging for 1 hour.

- **Memory**: A Droid's Trained Skills, Feats, and Talents can be reassigned with the Use Computer skill (see Reprogramming). A Droid hero can use its own Use Computer skill to perform this Reprogramming, but it takes a -5 penalty on its skill check. If a Droid is ever subjugated to a complete Memory Wipe, it becomes a basic model of its type, losing any levels and abilities gained.

- **Nonliving**: A Droid is immune to Poison, Disease, Radiation, noncorrosive Atmospheric Hazards, Vacuum, Mind-Affecting effects, Stunning effects, and any other effect that only works on living targets. Droids have no connection to The Force and can't gain the Force Sensitivity feat, or learn Force Powers.

- **Droid Destruction**: If a Droid is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it is disabled and cannot be reactivated until it is repaired so that it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the attack that reduced the Droid to 0 Hit Points also exceeds the Droid's Torso Damage Threshold, the Droid is destroyed instead.

- **Repair**:Droids tending a droid's body parts costs a use of a tool kit and takes a Mechanics check rather than using a medpac and a Treat Injury check. A Droid can use this application to repair itself, but it takes a -5 penalty on its skill check.

- **Shut Down**: A Droid that is Shut Down can take no actions and is effectively unconscious. Shutting down a willing Droid is a Standard Action. Shutting down an unwilling Droid is more difficult, requiring you to Grab the Droid, and then make a Mechanics check (DC = Droid's Will Defense) as a Standard Action while its Grabbed.

- **Systems**: Droids can have many of their characteristics changed by installing or replacing existing Droid Systems.

- **Degree**: Every droid has a degree which grants them additional traits.
### 1st Degree Traits
- **Ability Score Adjustment**: All first-degree droids have a +2 to both Intelligence and Wisdom but a -2 to Strength.
### 2nd Degree Traits
- **Ability  Score  Adjustment**:  All  second  degree  droids 
have a +4 to intelligence but a -2 to Charisma
### 3rd Degree Traits
- **Ability Score Adjustment**: All third degree droids have a 
+2 to both Wisdom and Charisma but a -2 to Strength
### 4th Degree Traits
- **Ability Score Adjustment**: All fourth degree droids have 
a +2 to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, but a -2 to 
both Intelligence and Charisma. 
### 5th Degree Traits
- **Ability Score Adjustment**: All fifth degree droids have a 
+4 to both Strength and Constitution, but a -2 to Wisdom, 
Intelligence, and Charisma. 

# Character Classes
## Heroic Level
Your heroic level is the sum total of the levels you have in each heroic and prestige class. If you are single-classing, your heroic level will be equal to your class level.
#### Leveling Up
You can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1 every 4 heroic levels. Alternatively, you can increase your training in 2 skills (untrained -> trained -> focused).
### Synced Characters
If you are playing a synced character (a character played across multiple leagues leveling up at the same time), you only gain an ability score increase from one system or the other. This means you get +2 per 4 levels, not +4.

If you opt to take a feat in Dreams and Drakes, you get the skill increase in Stellar Fantasies. Vise versa applies as well.
### Class Features
When you gain a level in a class, you get all of the features associated with that level (see the class table for the class in question).
### Multiclassing
When you level up, you can choose to either increase the level of a class you already have or become level 1 in a new class. The latter option is known as multiclassing.
Almost every character will be multiclassed at some point. Usually once they reach level 8 or level 13, as that is when the level-locked prestige classes become available.
### Class Level Features
What class features you get is based on your class level, not your heroic level.

# FEATS 
**V2.3** 
Where talents are simply something your character 
is capable of regularly, feats are the extraordinary 
things they can achieve when they push themselves. 
Mechanically, talents modify existing action but 
feats grant access to new actions. 

## Staring Feats 
Every character starts with one starting feat. 

Starting feats are tagged with the starting feat tag. 

## Core Feats 
A core feat is the feat that a feat tree is based on. In 
order to take any feat within a tree, you must have 
the core feat. Core feats have the same name as their 
titular feat tree. The first core feat you take also gives 
you three free feats from the same tree. 

## General Feats

The force surrounds and binds everything in the 
galaxy, however some of those things simply a part of 
the living force with no way to influence it. They are 
blind to the force, but no less a part of it. You are such 
a being. Your connection to the force is so innate and 
subconscious that you are unable to learn to 
manipulate it, but this makes you have a deeper 
connection since you are also unable to fight against 
its winds as most others do.

  requires manipulation of the force, such as the Force 
  Adept feat tree.

capabilities and even their habits and lifestyle, if given

  on checks to track the target. 

**Force Sensitive** (Starting Feat)  
You can feel the living force surrounding everything 
and binding it all together. If you focus, you can even 
learn things through the force by sensing how 
everything connects. 

You automatically feel disturbances in the force. 
Anytime a being calls upon the force or anytime lives 
are lost, a ripple is sent across the force, and if you are 
close enough or the ripple is close enough you feel it. 
You do not often know the source, but you can reach 
out to sense the force to learn more about the 
disturbance. 

You gain the following action:  

**Sense the Force (2 Actions)**  
- **Cost**: 1 Force Point  
- **Effect**: Learn the direction and rough distance of a disturbance in the force. When you do this, you disturb the force as well. Can also determine if a creature is force sensitive, but they can feel you searching them.

# Defenses

## Shield Rating
Incoming damage of the correct type is reduced by the shield rating.  
When the shield rating reduces damage, it is lowered by the same amount.

## Damage Reduction
After it gets past the shield rating, incoming damage of the correct type is reduced by damage reduction.

## Damage Threshold
- **Torso**: $ \text{Fort Defense} + 10 + \text{Armor} + \text{Misc} $
- **Limb**: $ \dfrac{\text{Torso}}{2} + \text{Misc} $

### Hit Location 
roll a d8, then
- 8 → Head, add a die of damage and roll again.  
- 7–5 → Torso
- 4–1 → Limbs

### Results
- If $ \text{Damage} \geq \text{Damage Threshold} $ → crippled body part.  
- If $ \text{Damage} < \text{Damage Threshold} $ → $\text{Body Part DT} - \text{Damage}$.

## Poise
- $ \text{Wis Bonus} + \text{Con Bonus} $

## Primary Defenses

### Fortitude
$ \text{Fort} = \text{Con Mod} + \text{Armor} + \text{Class} + \text{Misc} $

### Reflex
$ \text{Ref} = \text{Dex Mod} + \text{Armor} + \text{Class} + \text{Misc} $

### Willpower
$ \text{Will} = \text{Will Mod} + \text{Armor} + \text{Class} + \text{Misc} $

# Equipment
## Restricted Items
Some objects require licenses to own or operate or are restricted to qualifying organizations or individuals. In such cases, you must pay a license fee to own the object legally.
Restriction Ratings
#### Licensed
The owner must obtain a license to own or operate the object legally. Generally, the license is not expensive, and obtaining it has few if any additional legal requirements.
#### Restricted
Only specifically qualified individuals or organizations are technically allowed to own the object. However, the real obstacles to ownership are time and money; anyone with sufficient patience and cash can eventually acquire the necessary license.
#### Military
The object is sold primarily to legitimate police and military organizations. A military rating is essentially the same as restricted, except that manufacturers and dealers are generally under tight government scrutiny and are therefore especially wary of selling to private individuals.
#### Illegal
The object is illegal in all but specific, highly regulated circumstances.

### Getting a License
To get a license, you must pay the fee required to file the application. The amount of the fee is a percentage of the object’s normal cost, as listed in Restricted Objects. Once you’ve paid the fee, make a Knowledge (Bureaucracy) check against the DC listed in the Skill DC column.
On a success, your license is approved and will be available to you in a number of days as listed in the Time Required column.
On a failure, you spend a number of days as listed in the Time Required column, but you are not granted the license and your application fee is lost. You may try again as often as you like if you have the time and credits to do so.
Whether you succeed or fail on your Knowledge (Bureaucracy) check, your request is recorded in public records. The more restricted the license, the more in-depth the background check required, and this leaves an increasingly detailed electronic trail for others to follow.
You can choose to secure a license through illicit means:
If you want to bribe an official, make a Persuasion check instead of a Knowledge (Bureaucracy) check.
If you want to fabricate a false identity or steal another person’s identity, make a Deception check instead of a Knowledge (Bureaucracy) check.
If either of these checks fails by 5 or more, the local authorities are alerted to your activities.

| RESTRICTION RATING  | LICENSE FEE      | BLACK MARKET COST | SKILL DC | TIME REQUIRED |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| 1. Licensed         | $5\% \times 2$   | 10                | 10       | 1 day         |
| 2. Restricted       | $10\% \times 3$  | 15                | 15       | 2 days        |
| 3. Military         | $20\% \times 4$  | 20                | 20       | 5 days        |
| 4. Illegal          | $50\% \times 5$  | 25                | 25       | 10 days       |
| 5. Outright Illegal | $N/A \times 6$   | 30                | 30       | 20 days       |

**Notes**
1. The license fee is given as a percentage of the licensed object’s base cost.
2. This is for ST reference and can be ignored while purchasing items in character creation.
3. Illegal items are illegal for any use outside high clearance research or similar bans. Outright illegal items cannot even be purchased for this reason.

### The Black Market
Almost anything is available on the Black Market. However, you must make a Gather Information check to locate a Black Market merchant who has the object you seek.
The DC of the check is listed in the Skill DC column of the Restricted Objects table.
The GM may apply a bonus or penalty to the check depending on the circumstances.
If you succeed on the Gather Information check, you find a Black Market merchant who has access to the item you need.
If you fail to find a restricted item, you can try again later. If you fail by 5 or more, someone notices you've been asking questions and comes to capture, interrogate, or silence you.
Once you find someone who can acquire the item for you, you'll have to pay two, three, four, or five times the item's normal price (as listed in the *Black Market Cost* column of the *Restricted Items* table). You will also have to wait some time for the item to become available (as listed in the *Time Required* column).

### Rare Equipment
A Rare piece of equipment is generally available only on its planet of origin (for example, Naboo for the Atlatl and Cesta, or Kashyyyk for the Bowcaster) or by acquiring it directly from the manufacturer. When available on the open market elsewhere, Rare items usually cost double the listed price.

### Exotic Equipment
Exotic equipment is equipment that is both rare and unique to be comparable to a piece of general equipment. As such, use of exotic equipment requires special training in the form of the Exotic Proficiency feat. When you take the feat, they declare what exotic equipment they are being proficient in. Not only do they become proficient in that particular item but also in similar items. For example, you who is proficient in lightsabers would gain proficiency in double lightsabers, lightpikes (lightsaber pikes), lightclubs, lightwhips, and all other equipment following the same design principles.

## Weapons 
**v1.7**
### Weapon Qualities

#### Damage Types

**Energy**  
Energy damage is the most common type of damage.  
Energy weapons tend to at least partially cauterize wounds, making it harder to bleed out, and are therefore seen as more humane.  
It comes from blasters and most explosives.  

- Energy damage is blocked by ray-shielding (the most common type of Shield Rating).  
- **Kyber:** Energy weapons powered by a kyber crystal of lightsaber grade or larger ignore damage reduction.  

**Ion**  
Ion damage comes from weapons specialized to disable electronics.  

- Ion damage does **double damage** against electronic targets (energy shields, droids, ships, computers).  
- Ion damage does **half damage** against organic targets (such as most enemies).  

**Physical**  
Physical damage is most common in melee weapons, used to bypass personal energy shields. It can also be caused by projectiles, but the major galactic powers banned these as inhumane before the Clone Wars.  

- **Piercing:** Some physical damage is piercing, which partially ignores damage reduction (see *Piercing* weapon quality and *Damage Reduction* armor quality).  

#### Additional Qualities

**Ammo Count**  
This is the number of times a weapon can be fired before emptying an ammo pack and requiring reload, cooldown, or recharge.  
It represents *attack actions*, not necessarily projectiles. It may indicate bursts, sustained fire, or individual shots, depending on weapon flavor.  

**Reload (Standard Action):** Replace the weapon’s current ammo pack with another from your inventory.  

**Auto-Fire**  
- **Attack:** 2 standard actions  
- **AOE:** Line of sight within a 3-space-wide cone originating from you  
- **Cost:** 5 ammo  
- **Penalty:** –5 to hit  

Effects:  
- Attack any creature or object moving through the area or ending its turn there.  
- If a target moves through again in a different action, attack again.  
- Deal half damage on a miss.  
- Three-quarter blocks break line of sight. Half cover breaks line of sight if the target is prone.  

**Defensive**  
- While equipped, you can use the *Duck Behind* free action without cover (instead of the normal *Dodge* Swift Action).  
- As an action, the item can be raised to act as half cover, granting **+5 Reflex Defense** until your next action.  

**Delay**  
Targets of an attack with the *Delay* quality (including AOE effects) may use a number of actions equal to the delay value.  
- These actions must respond to the attack threat.  
- They generally cannot be used to make an attack.  

**Stun**  
- Stun range is always *close*, regardless of weapon range.  
- Stun damage always targets the torso.  
- If stun damage exceeds the torso’s Damage Threshold:  
  - Target is knocked unconscious for 1 minute, or until awakened by another creature.  
- After waking, the target’s critical failure range is increased by 5 for the rest of the encounter.  

### Weapon Sizes

#### Relative Size
- **One-Handed:** A weapon your size or smaller.  
- **Two-Handed:** A weapon one size category larger than you.  
- **Too Large to Hold:** A weapon two or more size categories larger than you.  
  - Using without a mount (bi-pod, tri-pod, etc.) imposes –5 penalty.  
  - Each additional size category adds another –5.  

#### Multiple Weapon Fighting
- **Light:** One size smaller. Off-hand penalty reduced by 5.  
- **Very-Light:** Two sizes smaller. Off-hand penalty reduced by 10. Grants +2 to concealment attempts.  
- **Extremely-Light:** Three sizes smaller. Off-hand penalty reduced by 15. Grants +5 to concealment attempts.  

#### Standard Sizes
- **Tiny:** Hold-out pistols, small knives  meant for concealment.  
- **Small:** Most pistols, clubs, short swords.  
- **Medium:** Carbines, large pistols, long swords.  
- **Large:** Rifles, two-handed melee (great swords, axes, spears).  
- **Huge:** Machine guns, cannons on tripods.  
- **Gargantuan/Colossal:** Rare at player scale, usually built into spaceships.

Accessory Descriptions
Ammo Pack
This could be a clip or magazine or other container of bullets, a battery pack for an energy weapon, or coolant for a weapon prone to overheating.

### Weapon Ranges
Each ranged weapon has an effective range within which they can be used without penalty. The ranges are point blank, short, medium, long, and extreme.
| Range   | Firefighting   | Sharpshooting | Melee|
| - | - | - | - |
|Point Blank| Within the target's melee reach | NA   | 1.5m or 5ft  |
|Close| 1 space| -1 for close range weapon | 1-6 spaces   |
| Short | 15m, 50ft  | 1 Space  | 7-12 spaces  |
|Medium| 30m, 100ft | 2 Spaces | 13-18 spaces |
|Long| 300m, 500ft| 3 Spaces | 19-24 spaces |
|Extreme| 600m, 2000ft   | 4 Spaces | 25-30 spaces |

No Penalty for Short Range Weapons
No penalty applies to short-range weapons.
A -6 penalty applies to long-range weapons.

### Range Differences
The difference between medium, long, and extreme weapon ranges only comes into play when combat exceeds a 1-space = 1.5-meter diameter area, such as on battle mats that are typically 22x22 spaces.

Close-Range Penalties for Long-Range Weapons
Weapons with short range or longer incur penalties at close range (see Close-Range Penalty Table below).

Reaction Attacks and Opportunity Attack
When a ranged attack is made:
Any creature within the attack's point-blank range that has a melee weapon out, a natural melee weapon, or a built-in melee weapon can use their reaction to move up to their movement speed towards the attacker and make an attack of opportunity against them.
Attacks against a target within melee range incur a -5 situation penalty.

#### Notes
1. Can be worn with other helmets or armor.  
2. Requires a Power Pack to use. Without a charged pack, wearer takes –2 penalty to all Str and Dex checks (lasts 24 hours).  
   a. Powered armor can be added to a suit of armor up to two times, each time costing 50% of the armor’s cost.  

### Armor Proficiency and Penalties

While wearing armor you are **not proficient** with, you take an **armor check penalty** on:  

- Attack rolls  
- Skill checks using the following skills:  
  - Acrobatics  
  - Climb  
  - Endurance  
  - Initiative  
  - Jump  
  - Stealth  
  - Swim  

#### Penalty by Proficiency
The type of armor compared to your proficiency determines the penalty:  

- **No Armor Proficiency:**  
  - Light Armor: –2  
  - Medium Armor: –5  
  - Heavy Armor: –10  

- **Light Armor Proficiency:**  
  - Medium Armor: –2  
  - Heavy Armor: –5  

- **Medium Armor Proficiency:**  
  - Heavy Armor: –2  

#### Equipment Bonuses
Even if you are not proficient, you still gain the armor’s equipment bonuses.  

*Example:*  
A character **not proficient with Light Armor** who dons **Stormtrooper Armor** takes a –2 penalty on attacks and the listed skills.  
However, they **do gain** the armor’s equipment bonus on **Perception checks** and may apply its bonus to **Fortitude Defense**.  

### Shields

#### Personal Energy Shields
Personal Energy Shields give a character a **Shield Rating (SR)**, which functions like normal shielding.  

- Worn on the **forearm or upper arm**.  
- Must be **activated as a Swift Action**.  
- **Charges:** 5 per shield.  
- **Limit:** Can only be activated **once per encounter**.  
  - The stress of activation would otherwise overload the generator, so failsafes prevent repeated use.  
- **Duration:** Each activation lasts until the **end of the encounter**.  

#### Types of Energy Shields
- **Energy Shield (Rey Shield):** Protects against **Energy damage** only.  
- **Force Shield:** Protects against **Energy and Physical damage**.  
- Any other damage type **bypasses the SR entirely**.  

#### Shield Rating Costs
| Shield Rating | Cost|
| - | - |
| 5 | $500|
| 10| $2,000  |
| 15| $4,500  |
| 20| $8,000  |
| 25| $12,500 |
| 30| $18,000 |
**Force Shields cost twice as much**

# The Force

The nature of the Force is hotly debated throughout the galaxy and within the fanbase. Many traditions view the Force in terms of Light and Dark, but even among those traditions that share the binary/gradient model, there is debate on how the Light and Dark sides interact. The Jedi tradition is a notable example.  

The rules in this book (unless stated otherwise) use the most common model of the Force: the Light/Dark Binary/Gradient, as seen in the majority of Star Wars media. The exact interpretation of this model is ultimately up to the Storyteller.

---

## Common Views

### Jedi
The Jedi believe that when the Force is in balance, the galaxy prospers. Conversely, anywhere the Force is not in balance will be corrupted and decay.

#### Light Jedi
The majority of the Jedi Order are Light Jedi, though some notable Jedi (e.g., Qui-Gon Jinn, Ahsoka Tano, and potentially Mace Windu) could be considered Grey Jedi.  

Light Jedi believe that the Light Side of the Force—representing serenity and calm—is balance. Practicing the Light Side requires detachment from emotional connection and personal investment.  

- **Strengths:** Promotes rational thinking and clarity.  
- **Weaknesses:** Can lead to lack of empathy, causing Jedi to avoid conflicts where their intervention is needed or choose the wrong side in pursuit of the "rational" choice.

#### Dark Jedi
Historically, the Judi (precursor to Jedi and Sith) welcomed those who would not be considered Dark Jedi today.  

The term Dark Jedi often describes Jedi who have "fallen" to the Dark Side, driven by personal interest rather than altruism. A true Dark Jedi, however, follows the teachings of the ancient dark Judi. Dark Jedi originally founded the Sith, though the Sith tradition has since evolved.  

Dark Jedi believe the Dark Side—representing liveliness and activity—is balance. Practicing the Dark Side requires deep investment in emotional connection and personal involvement.  

- **Strengths:** Promotes empathy and quick action for causes.  
- **Weaknesses:** Excessive emotional involvement can blind one to rational responses, sometimes leading to disastrous outcomes.

#### Grey Jedi
Grey Jedi believe that both Light and Dark Jedi have merit and flaws. They seek a balance between serenity and liveliness, calmness and activity.  

- **Practice:** Constant self-evaluation to ensure emotional connection does not overwhelm judgment, and vice versa.  
- **Challenge:** Difficult to maintain in practice; many tend to lean towards one side while believing they are centred.

## Force Alignment

Force alignment measures a character’s standing with the Force based on the Dark/Light model, using their Darkside score relative to their Wisdom score.

- **Light-Aligned:** Darkside < Wisdom. Logical, controlled emotions; softer features; eyes with faint shifting colours.  
- **Pure Light:** Darkside = 0 or less than ¼ Wisdom. Complete detachment.  
- **Grey-Aligned:** Darkside = Wisdom. Balanced emotion and reason; extremely rare.  
- **Dark-Aligned:** Darkside > Wisdom. Emotionally driven; prominent veins; gold/red eye tints.  
- **Pure Dark:** Darkside > 2 × Wisdom. Overwhelmed by emotion; uncontrollable outbursts.

## Force Schools
**v1.3**

**Authors:** fighter81tdiscord, notcursedenoughdiscord, Cearul O’Laurel’n’Dean  
**Editors:** Cearul O’Laurel’n’Dean  

This system allows players more creative freedom with the Force, not limited to predefined powers.

### Light and Dark
- **Light Side:** Serenity and balance with emotions, promotes calm in oneself and the galaxy.  
- **Dark Side:** Turmoil and disorder, emotions run freely, causing chaos.

### Falling to the Dark Side

#### Gaining Darkside Score
1. **Emotional Impulse:** Acting on intense emotions (grief, anger, fear) increases Darkside by 1.  
2. **Disturbing the Balance:** Manipulating the Living Force destructively increases Darkside proportional to the act’s severity (ST discretion). Includes murder, mass destruction, or causing widespread suffering.

#### Dark Urges
Dark Side amplifies emotions. A character under intense emotion rolls Willpower vs Darkside DC:  
- **Fail:** Dominant emotion drives character during encounter.  
- **Opportunity to Indulge:** Another Willpower roll to resist; fail = must act, +1 Darkside.  

**Dark-Consumed Characters:** If Darkside > 2 × Wisdom, the character is compelled to act on urges with no resistance.

#### Ending a Dark Urge
Spend all actions to attempt a Wisdom Use the Force Check vs Darkside DC. Success calms emotions; failure imposes -5 on future attempts in the same encounter.

#### Reducing Darkside Score
- **Recentering:** Roleplay emotional processing or self-actualisation.  
- **Downtime:** 1 day reduces Darkside by 1. Resting in safety for a night reduces Darkside by 1.  
- **Bringing Balance:** Acts that restore balance decrease Darkside (ST discretion).

## Force Points
- Heroic characters: Force points = ½ level + 5 (modifiable by Storyteller).  
- Non-heroic characters: Usually 1 Force point.  

### Using Force Points
1. **Add to Roll:** Any Ability or Attack roll, 1 point = +1d6.  
2. **Regain:** Rest 8 hours to regain Force points.  
3. **Manipulate the Force:** Spend Force point, describe effect to Storyteller.

### Light vs Dark Side Uses
- **Light Side:** Compassion and empathy (healing, non-lethal restraint). High Darkside may require Wisdom check.  
- **Dark Side:** Violence, destruction, destabilising the Force. Using a Dark Side power increases Darkside by 1.

### Force Check
- **Roll:** Use the Force check + Force points + specialization bonus.  
- **Target Defences:** Body (Fortitude), External (Reflex), Mind/Force (Willpower).  
- **Duration:** Default instantaneous; extra points/destiny points extend duration exponentially.

### Hybrid School Uses
- Use school of greatest specialization; if between multiple schools, ST chooses the two most relevant.

## Force Schools

### Alchemy
Manipulate matter, energy, and Force to alter materials or imbue objects. Rarely used on living creatures due to strain. Force points grant temporary effects; long-term effects require special rules (e.g., Force Acolyte talent).

### Augmentation
Enhance the body using the Force—accuracy, speed, strength, agility.

### Cognition
Force use on the mind—telepathy, influencing thoughts, illusions, sensing across space/time.

### Sorcery
Manipulate the Living Force—generate lightning, interfere with enemy Force use, channel environmental Force energy.

### Technokinesis
Control, sabotage, or repair machinery and circuitry with the Force.

### Telekinesis
Move or stop objects physically without touching them.

### Vitalism
Influence metabolic processes—heal wounds, cure ailments, or afflict enemies.

# Running Stellar Fantasies: Encounters

Though there are multiple scales at which an encounter can take place (see Encounter Scale), unless specified otherwise, this chapter is written with **character scale** in mind. An encounter is any high-stakes situation where character action can affect the outcome. Though combat is the first thing to come to mind for many TTRPG players, there are many examples of this. Perhaps the characters need to spacewalk in an unstable asteroid field, or perhaps they are having a diplomatic meal with a planet's governor, where every word could affect the outcome.

## Character Scale

In character scale, each inch is roughly 5 feet, thus each space on a 1-inch grid is as well. Each space easily contains one medium creature but cannot easily contain two.

### Initiative

Round-based initiative is one of the two major initiative variants commonly used in Stellar Fantasies. Both **Round-Based Initiative** (official variant) and **Turn-Based Initiative** (as in D&D 5e) are valid ways to play. Round-Based Initiative is designed to keep all players engaged at all points of an encounter. There is no turn order; characters take actions freely when they see the opportunity.  

### Rounds

A round ensures no one gets left behind in an encounter. Every character will have done something before the round ends. A round is often a very brief amount of in-game time; in action-based situations such as a chase or combat, a round lasts around 6 seconds.  

Each round, each character has **four actions** they can spend – two standard actions and two swift actions (see Actions to learn how they can be used). At the end of the round, once everyone has either used all their actions or forfeited them, a new round starts, and everyone regains their actions.

### Taking Action

Characters use actions by doing things. In a diplomatic meeting, for example, they might try to convince a governor that there are terrorists on the planet. To do so, they would likely use the **Hold Dialogue** standard action.

### Interjecting

When you take an action that another character wants to participate in or influence, the other character can interject.  

- **Assisting**: The second character can assist using the **Aid** action.  
- **Impeding**: Both characters make opposed initiative checks. If the first character's check is higher, the second character does not act in time. If the second character’s check is higher, they act to impede, and the Storyteller decides the required check. DC is 10 unless the situation warrants otherwise.

**Moving Target**: Interjecting to make an attack against a moving target grants the target a +5 cover bonus to Reflex Defense as if they were in half cover.

### Actions of Opportunity

A common interjection. When a character exposes themselves to reprisal, others can interject using a swift action.

### Squad Turns

Participants may act in squads of allied creatures. Each squad shares a turn. Turn order is determined by **Knowledge (Tactics)** if necessary. Circumstances can adjust order (e.g., surprised squads act later; favourable conditions grant +10).  

During a squad's turn, each member takes their actions in any order. Once all squads act, a new round begins. This initiative method suits large groups or groups struggling with round-based initiative.

### Two-Systems

Stellar Fantasies has **two combat systems**:

- **Melee system**: Supports parry, riposte, and cinematic sword fights where a single hit can be decisive.  
- **Ranged system**: Supports flanking and squad tactics; being out of position increases danger.  

Crossover occurs naturally, allowing ranged and melee combatants to interact in the same skirmish.

## Melee Combat

**Poise** is central. Characters with Melee Weapon Finesse have poise, a measure of structured posture. The goal is to break an opponent's poise to land debilitating strikes.

### Determining Poise

Maximum poise = Wisdom Bonus + Constitution Bonus (+ Dark Side Bonus if applicable).  

**Terrain Effects**: Each adjacent occupied or difficult space reduces poise by 1.

## Firefight

**Cover** is central. It determines how difficult it is to hit a target. The goal is to flank opponents to take them down.  

### Crossover

- **Melee vs Ranged**: Difficulty lies in reaching the ranged combatant.  
- **Ranged vs Melee**: Minorly distracts melee characters.

## Actions

Each heroic character has **four actions per round** (2 standard, 2 swift). **Free actions** can be used without limit.  

### Non-Heroic Actions

Non-heroic characters get **1 non-heroic action** + 2 swift actions. Non-heroic actions allow 2 of: attack (twice), move (twice), complex object interaction, or special ability.

If an action doesn’t fall under standard categories, the Storyteller determines the type and success requirements.
